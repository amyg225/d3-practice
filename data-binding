## Breaking it down

```
d3.select("body") — Finds the body in the DOM and hands a reference off to the next step in the chain.

.selectAll("p") — Selects all paragraphs in the DOM. Since none exist yet, this returns an empty selection. Think of this empty selection as representing the paragraphs that will soon exist.
            -------what happens if there are other <p>'s  in the DOM?

.data(dataset) — Counts and parses our data values. There are five values in our data set, so everything past this point is executed five times, once for each value.

*****
.enter() — To create new, data-bound elements, you must use enter(). This method looks at the DOM, and then at the data being handed to it. If there are more data values than corresponding DOM elements, then enter() creates a new placeholder element on which you may work your magic. It then hands off a reference to this new placeholder to the next step in the chain.
*****

.append("p") — Takes the placeholder selection created by enter() and inserts a p element into the DOM. Hooray! Then it hands off a reference to the element it just created to the next step in the chain.

.text("New paragraph!") — Takes the reference to the newly created p and inserts a text value.
